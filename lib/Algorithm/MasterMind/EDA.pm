=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::EDA - Solver using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithm


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::EDA;
    my $secret_code = 'EAFC';
    my $population_size = 200;
    my @alphabet = qw( A B C D E F );
    my $solver = new Algorithm::MasterMind::EDA { alphabet => \@alphabet,
						length => length( $secret_code ),
						  pop_size => $population_size};
  
    #The rest, same as the other solvers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses L<Algorithm::Evolutionary> instance of EDAs to solve MM; as there
are two different fitness functions you can use; probably
C<fitness_orig> works better. 

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 initialize 

Performs bookkeeping, and assigns flags depending on the
initialization values

=head2 entropy( $combination)

Computes the Jensen-Shannon entropy of the string and returns it.

=head2 fitness_compress( $object ) 

Uses as fitness the entropy of the string attached to all the strings
already played computed above. 

=head2 new ( $options )

This function, and all the rest, are directly inherited from base

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues the first combination, which might be generated in a particular
way 

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination

=head2 feedback()

Obtain the result to the last combination played

=head2 guesses()

Total number of guesses

=head2 evaluated()

Total number of combinations checked to issue result

=head2 number_of_rules ()

Returns the number of rules in the algorithm

=head2 rules()

Returns the rules (combinations, blacks, whites played so far) y a
reference to array

=head2 matches( $string ) 

Returns a hash with the number of matches, and whether it matches
every rule with the number of blacks and whites it obtains with each
of them

=head2 fitness( $individual )

Computes fitness summing the number of correct black and whites plus
the number of rules the combination meets times the length

=head2 fitness_orig( $individual )

Fitness proposed in the Applied and Soft Computing paper, difference
between the number of blacks/whites obtained by rules against the
secret code and by the combination against the combination in the
rule. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

Other solvers: L<Algorithm::MasterMind::Sequential> and
L<Algorithm::MasterMind::Random>. Don't work as well, really.
