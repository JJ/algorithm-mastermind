=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::Sequential - Tests each combination in turn.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::Sequential;

    my $secret_code = 'ADCB';
    my @alphabet = qw( A B C D E F );
    my $solver = new Algorithm::MasterMind::Sequential { alphabet => \@alphabet,
						       length => length( $secret_code ) };
    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test combinations in turn, starting by A x length. Should find the
solution, but complexity increases with size. Not very efficient.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 initialize()

Called from base class, mainly

=head2 new ( $options )

This function, and all the rest, are directly inherited from base

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues the first combination, which might be generated in a particular
way 

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination

=head2 feedback()

Obtain the result to the last combination played

=head2 guesses()

Total number of guesses

=head2 evaluated()

Total number of combinations checked to issue result

=head2 number_of_rules ()

Returns the number of rules in the algorithm

=head2 rules()

Returns the rules (combinations, blacks, whites played so far) y a
reference to array

=head2 matches( $string ) 

Returns a hash with the number of matches, and whether it matches
every rule with the number of blacks and whites it obtains with each
of them
