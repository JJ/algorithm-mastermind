=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::Test - Mock class used for testing algorithms
by hand


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::Test;

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mainly used in test functions, and as a way of instantiating base
class. 


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 initialize()

Does nothing, really

=head2 new ( $options )

This function, and all the rest, are directly inherited from base

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues the first combination, which might be generated in a particular
way 

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination

=head2 feedback()

Obtain the result to the last combination played

=head2 guesses()

Total number of guesses

=head2 evaluated()

Total number of combinations checked to issue result

=head2 number_of_rules ()

Returns the number of rules in the algorithm

=head2 rules()

Returns the rules (combinations, blacks, whites played so far) y a
reference to array

=head2 matches( $string ) 

Returns a hash with the number of matches, and whether it matches
