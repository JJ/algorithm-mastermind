=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::Canonical_GA - Tries to compute new solution from last


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::Canonical_GA;

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mainly used in test functions, and as a way of instantiating base
class. 


=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 fitness()

Returns the vectorial fitness for each combination, which combines
entropy and the distance to a consistent combination.

=head2 initialize()

Does nothing, really

=head2 new ( $options )

This function, and all the rest, are directly inherited from base

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues the first combination, which might be generated in a particular
way 

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination
