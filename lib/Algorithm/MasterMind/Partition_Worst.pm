=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Worst - Plays by Knuth's playbook


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Worst;
    my $secret_code = 'EAFC';
    my @alphabet = qw( A B C D E F );
    my $solver = new Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Worst { alphabet => \@alphabet,
						   length => length( $secret_code ) };

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Solves the algorithm by issuing each time a combination that minimizes
the size of the worst partition. This intends to maximally reduce the
search space each time; it was the first algorithm used to play
mastermind, but it's no longer state of the art, and does not work
very well for spaces higher than 4-6. In fact, it will probably take a
lot of time (and use a lot of memory) for 5-9 already, so use it
carefully. 

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 initialize()

Called from C<new>

=head2 new ( $options )

This function, and all the rest, are directly inherited from base

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues it in the Knuth way, AABC. This should probably be computed
from scratch, but it's already published, so what the hell.

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination

=head2 feedback()

Obtain the result to the last combination played

=head2 guesses()

Total number of guesses

=head2 evaluated()

Total number of combinations checked to issue result

=head2 number_of_rules ()

Returns the number of rules in the algorithm

=head2 rules()

Returns the rules (combinations, blacks, whites played so far) y a
reference to array

=head2 matches( $string ) 

Returns a hash with the number of matches, and whether it matches
every rule with the number of blacks and whites it obtains with each
of them
