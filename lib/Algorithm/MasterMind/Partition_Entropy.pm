=head1 NAME

Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Entropy - Plays combination  using max entropy for all moves


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Entropy;
    my $secret_code = 'EAFC';
    my @alphabet = qw( A B C D E F );
    my $solver = new Algorithm::MasterMind::Partition_Worst { alphabet => \@alphabet,
						   length => length( $secret_code ) };

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Solves the algorithm by issuing each time a combination that maximizes
the number of non-null partitions. This intends to maximally reduce
the search space each time; I wouldn't advice using it for sizes over
4-6. In fact, it will probably take a lot of time (and use a lot of
memory) for 4-8 already, so use it carefully.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 initialize()

Called from C<new>, initializes data structures.

=head2 issue_first ()

Issues a random string among the top scorers.

=head2 issue_next()

Issues the next combination
