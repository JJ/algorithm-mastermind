2010-01-27    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* MANIFEST: Changed license back to "perl". Mostly, in order to
	not have to modify all source. Added lots of new files with new
	algorithms (and rather esoteric, I admit).

2010-01-26    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.PL: Added license and changed min version of
	Algorithm::Evolutionary, just uploaded. Changed lots of modules
	after profiling (check_combination, again), and added more
	algorithms. 

2009-11-24  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind.pm: Changed to 0.2 due to the new
	modules added.

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind/Evolutionary.pm: The new single
	objective evolutionary works at least as well ad the old
	EDA. Let's see if we can add partitions to it.

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind/Evolutionary_Base.pm (issue_first):
	Completed motion of some functions to this class. Now on to the
	evolutionary single_objective.

	* t/06_moga.t: Since this MOGA does not seem to be able to find
	the solution, I'll just do an iteration.

2009-11-23  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* MANIFEST: Added a multiobjective evolutionary that tries to find
	the combination via finding consistent combinations.

2009-11-17    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind.pm: Starting 0.1.1, which will include
	multiobjective algorithms and most of the stuff we're preparing
	for EvoStar. Starting with minor doc changes.

2009-11-17  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* MANIFEST: Added several new algorithms, including Knuth's and
	EDA. 
	Changed minor to 0.1, since it's quite complete now. 

2009-10-10    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind.pm (check_combination): Saving around
	30% of the CPU time via optimization of this subroutine. Still
	some room for improvement, though:

2009-10-03    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* t/00_functions.t: Fixed typo in test

2009-10-02    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.PL: Added Algorithm::Combinatorics which is used to
	compute next combination in the Sequential algorithm

2009-10-02  Juan J. Merelo  <jmerelo@vega>

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind.pm (not_in_combination): Starting 0.0.4
	with adding info to the main module file.

	* MANIFEST: Fixing a distribution but in 0.0.2 and also adding new
	methods. Fixed bugs in Sequential, and added program to run
	experiments. 

2009-10-01  Juan Julian Merelo Guervos  <jmerelo@geneura.ugr.es>

	* MANIFEST: Started version 0.0.3 after fixing docs form version
	one. Still waiting for fail reports.

2009-09-30    <jmerelo@localhost.localdomain>

	* lib/Algorithm/MasterMind.pm (not_in_combination): Changing all
	documentation to avoid problems, and added a few things.

	* MANIFEST: Added set of files to the MANIFEST, and preparing
	stuff for initial release
