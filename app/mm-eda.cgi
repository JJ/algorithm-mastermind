=head1 NAME

mm-eda.cgi - CGI for playing an Mastermind using an Estimation of Distribution Algorithms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  http://localhost/cgi-bin/mm-eda.cgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION  

This script uses L<Algorithm::Mastermind::EDA> for playing a basic
Mastermind game, with 6 colors and 4 pegs. When called without
parameters it shows a form for introducing the secret combination, if
called with parameter C<code> it will call the algorithm and produce
the solution. It usually takes less than a second, but your mileage
may vary depending on the server and Perl version.

=head1 INTERFACE

Not really intended to be called as a module, but there are a few
functions you could use

=head2 print_combination( $combination, $response );

Prints combination and response in HTML

=head2 solve ($code )

Runs the algorithm for $code

=head2 show_form

Shows the form page in absence of code.

=head2 form

Actually prints the form part in HTML


=head1 SEE ALSO


First, you should obviously check, L<Algorithm::MasterMind>, and maybe
also L<Algorithm::Evolutionary::Op::EDA_step );
