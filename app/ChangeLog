	* run_experiment_instances.pl: Fixing a bug counting the number of
	moves (it counted 2 when the combination was found in the first
	move) and running again entropy1 with a changed first move (ABCD).

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-entropy-4-6.yaml (ID): This one really takes a
	long time: 
	real	1507m51.227s
user	1506m23.890s
sys	0m13.900s

	Bit more than most-parts, indeed. Maybe simply due to the small
	additional complication (but, then, 10% more?)

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-entropy1-4-6.yaml (Method): Testing this new
	version with fixed first move. 

	real	34m42.293s
user	34m39.940s
sys	0m0.200s

	Almost the same as most-parts.

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-most1-4-6.yaml (Method): Testing this, result:
	real	33m42.703s
user	33m37.910s

	Obviously much better. Let's see the average.

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-most-4-6.yaml (ID):

	and worse average than before:

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-evo-8-12-p10k-cs1k-r075-x8-m1-t7.yaml
	(Method_options): Previous one took too long (more than 20
	minutes). Let's try this one until we refactor and see what can be
	fixed. 

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-evo-8-12-p8k-cs2k-r075-x8-m1-t7.yaml
	(Method_options): 
	Let's try duplicating consistent set size to get closer to
	Berghman's (even if this one is with only 100 combinations, not 500)

	* IEEE-CIG/conf-evo-8-12-p8k-cs1k-r075-x8-m1-t7.yaml (ID): 
	This one really takes a long time:
	real	3917m51.488s
user	3915m26.890s

twice as much (or more), probably due to the bigger consistent set size.

	Eliminating permutation yields good results:

and speeds up, just a bit...

	Let's check the number of moves. Good, but not perfect:

	These are the results. I have not kept the previous ones, but
	looks good. 

2012-04-30  Juan J. Merelo Guervós  <jjmerelo@gmail.com>

	* CIG/conf-evo-6-9-p1k-cs100-r075-x8-p1-m1-t7.yaml
	(Method_options): Previous version had permutation wrong. Changing
	in this one (but I'm afraid it will not have much influence)

	* CIG/conf-evo-6-9-p1k-cs100-r075-x8-p1-m1-t3.yaml
	(Method_options): This one obtained much better results than
	previous version, in half the time:

	seconds per game. Much better... But already too late for this
	version of the paper.

	* CIG/conf-evo-6-9-p1k-cs100-r075-x8-p1-m1-t3.yaml

	Results with the previous version of this:

	19.35820000000000000000 per game. Not bad, not great either. 

	* CIG/conf-evo-4-8-p400-cs30-r025-x8-p1-m1.yaml (Method_options):
	Problems here: I was using crossover_rate instead of xover_rate
	for that parameter, which means that xover had default value all
	over. Not a big deal, since results were not that bad, but it
	would be interesting to see if this new value really has an
	effect.

	From the get-go, it's slower. Let's look at numbers.

	* CIG/conf-evo-4-8-p512.yaml (ID): OK, let's start writing an
	experiment logl. I am testing this new file just to get a grasp of
	how everything works. First results:
